 ### Draft `README.md` for **HarmonixPy**

---

# **HarmonixPy**

**HarmonixPy** is a Python library designed to simplify the process of managing external files (e.g., HTML, dependency files) in Python projects. It provides a seamless way to load and serve HTML files using Flask while automating the installation of dependencies from a `requirements.txt` file.  

This library is ideal for developers working on lightweight backend projects or environments like **Pydroid**, which have limited support for external files.

---

## **Key Features**
- **File Management:** Load external HTML files and dependency files into your Python project with minimal effort.  
- **Flask Integration:** Serve HTML files dynamically using Flask’s `render_template_string`.  
- **Dependency Automation:** Automatically install required dependencies from a `requirements.txt` file using `subprocess`.  
- **Customizable Paths:** Flexible configuration for specifying the paths of your HTML and dependency files.  

---

## **Installation**
Install HarmonixPy using pip:
```bash
pip install harmonixpy
```

---

## **Quick-Start Example**
Here’s how to use **HarmonixPy** in your project:

### **Step 1: Create Your HTML File and Requirements File**
- Save your HTML file at `emulated/0/index.html`.
- Save your dependencies in a `requirements.txt` file, such as:
  ```
  flask
  requests
  beautifulsoup4
  ```

### **Step 2: Write Your Python Code**
```python
from harmonixpy import HarmonixPy

# Initialize the library with file paths
app = HarmonixPy(html_path="emulated/0/index.html", requirements_file="requirements.txt")

# Run the app
app.run()
```

### **Step 3: What Happens Under the Hood**
1. The library reads the HTML file and dynamically renders it using Flask.  
2. It parses the `requirements.txt` file and installs missing dependencies automatically.  
3. A Flask web server is launched to serve the HTML file.

### **Output**
Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser, and you’ll see the content of your HTML file rendered as a web page.
